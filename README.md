## 🔑 The Core Principle: The Seebeck Effect  

At the heart of TEGs lies the **Seebeck Effect**: when two different materials are joined and exposed to a temperature difference, a voltage is produced.  

A single TEG “leg” consists of:  

- 🔥 **Hot Side (TH)**  
- **n-type semiconductor** (electron flow ↓)  
- **p-type semiconductor** (hole flow ↓)  
- 🧊 **Cold Side (TC)**  
- ⚡ **Voltage output across a load resistor**  

That’s the basic recipe for turning a thermal gradient into electricity.

## ⚔️ The Challenge & 🪄 The Cascaded Solution  

A single thermoelectric material only works well in a **specific temperature range**.  
But what if your heat source is blazing hot — say, 1000 K — and your sink is much cooler?  

👉 Enter the **multi-stage (cascaded) TEG system**:  
- **Stage 1:** High-temperature material (e.g. Silicon-Germanium, SiGe)  
- **Stage 2:** Mid-temperature material (e.g. Skutterudites)  
- **Stage 3:** Low-temperature material (e.g. Bismuth Telluride, Bi₂Te₃)  

Each stage is tuned for its temperature window, giving you **much higher overall efficiency** than any single material could manage.
